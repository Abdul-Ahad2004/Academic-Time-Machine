1. Always label both the axis of a graph
2. Write the equations and math properly.  Use equation editor for equations and make sure all subscripts and superscripts appear properly.
3. While coding in Matlab, DO NOT hard code anything.  Use the size function to get data sizes.
4. In Matlab use matrix operations as much as possible.  AVOID LOOPS as much as you can.  For example to compute:
   the sum of (x_i - mean)^T(x_i - mean) for all points stored in data matrix X you can do the following:
	average = mean(X);
	%compute difference of every point from mean...as matrix sizes are not the same 
	%make average the same number of rows as X
	[row col] = size(X);
	average = repmat(average,row,1);
	diff = X-average;
	diff = diff.*diff;
	requiredSum = sum(sum(diff,2));
5. In your report always specify what is meant by "error" or "accuracy" by clearly specifying the evaluation measure like AUC or BER etc.
6. Don't leave blank headings
7. Instead of writing "figure below" or "the figure above", assign a number and caption to each figure and refer to them via this number.
