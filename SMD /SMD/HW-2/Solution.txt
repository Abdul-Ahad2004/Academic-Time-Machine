Suppose, the messaging application developed as a series of assignments in this course, is developed using a Web View. What may be the benefits/drawbacks in this case?

Benefit will be to work it out as a hybrid application, which will make it easier to deploy on multiple platforms.

Drawback will be the drop in performance in comparison with a native application.
